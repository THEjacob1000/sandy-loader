# Memory Manager

This crate provides comprehensive memory optimization and management for SandyLoader, implementing efficient alternatives to Java's memory-intensive structures.

## Purpose

- Reduce overall memory usage through efficient data structures
- Implement resource pooling and sharing between mods
- Provide memory usage tracking and analysis
- Create Rust alternatives for memory-intensive Java operations

## Key Components to Implement

- `allocator.rs` - Custom allocators for Minecraft data patterns
- `resource_pool.rs` - Pooling for frequently reused objects
- `shared_resources.rs` - Cross-mod resource sharing
- `tracking.rs` - Memory usage tracking and reporting
- `data_structures/` - Memory-efficient alternatives to Java collections
  - `block_storage.rs` - Optimized block storage
  - `entity_storage.rs` - Efficient entity data management
  - `chunk_storage.rs` - Memory-efficient chunk data
- `gc_integration.rs` - Integration with Java garbage collection

## Integration Points

- Used by mod API to provide memory-efficient interfaces
- Interfaces with JNI bridge for Java object management
- Provides hooks for profiler to analyze memory usage
- Supplies optimized implementations to registry system

## Development Notes

- This is the core differentiator for SandyLoader - focus on measurable improvements
- Create benchmarks to validate memory usage reductions
- Consider implementation of specialized allocators for Minecraft data patterns
- Implement memory pressure handling for low-memory situations
- Develop adaptive memory usage based on available RAM
