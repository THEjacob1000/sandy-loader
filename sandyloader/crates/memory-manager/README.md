# Memory Manager for SandyLoader

A specialized memory management system designed for efficient, optimized memory usage in the Minecraft modding ecosystem.

## Overview

The Memory Manager crate is the heart of SandyLoader's memory optimization strategy. It provides a comprehensive system for tracking, optimizing, and managing memory usage in Rust-based Minecraft mods. By implementing efficient memory allocation strategies and shared resource pooling, it dramatically reduces the memory footprint of modded Minecraft.

## Features

- Custom memory allocation and tracking
- Shared resource pools across mods
- Memory usage analysis and reporting
- Dynamic memory management based on system constraints
- Optimization of common Minecraft data structures
- Memory leak detection and prevention

## Technical Approach

The Memory Manager employs several advanced techniques to optimize memory usage:

1. **Custom Allocators**: Specialized allocators for common Minecraft data patterns
2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse of commonly allocated objects
3. **Shared Resources**: Common resources shared between mods to avoid duplication
4. **Memory Tracking**: Detailed tracking of mod memory consumption
5. **Lazy Loading**: Loading resources only when needed
6. **Data Structure Optimization**: Memory-efficient alternatives to Java collections

## Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Tracking

```rust
use memory_manager::MemoryManager;

fn main() {
    // Create a new memory manager
    let manager = MemoryManager::new();
    
    // Track memory usage for a mod
    manager.track_mod_memory("my-awesome-mod").expect("Failed to track mod memory");
    
    // Memory usage operations will be expanded as implementation progresses
}
```

### Planned API Features

```rust
// These examples represent planned functionality

// Allocate from a shared pool
let block_data = manager.allocate_from_pool::<BlockData>(BlockDataPool);

// Register a shared resource
manager.register_shared_resource("textures.common", texture_atlas);

// Set memory usage limits
manager.set_mod_memory_limit("my-mod", 100 * 1024 * 1024); // 100MB limit

// Get memory usage statistics
let stats = manager.get_memory_stats("my-mod");
println!("Current usage: {} MB", stats.current_usage / (1024 * 1024));
```

## Current Status

The Memory Manager is in early development. Current focus areas include:

1. Defining the core architecture
2. Implementing basic tracking functionality
3. Researching optimal allocation strategies
4. Designing shared resource mechanisms

## Planned Features

- **Hierarchical Memory Pools**: Specialized memory pools for different resource types
- **Adaptive Memory Management**: Dynamically adjust memory usage based on system load
- **Cross-Mod Memory Sharing**: Identify and consolidate duplicate data across mods
- **Memory Pressure Handling**: Gracefully handle low-memory situations
- **Integration with Profiler**: Use profiling data to guide optimization strategies
